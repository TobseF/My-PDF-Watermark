   Drag and move a PDF file onto the app shortcut.
4. Command Line Mode
   Run the app with command line and a path to a PDF file as argument:
    ``` shell
    java -jar MyWatermark.jar path/my_document.pdf
    ```

## 🛠 Configuration

Change settings in the `config.ini`:

```properties
# Can be an absolute path to the save location.
# Can be emtpy or `same`, to save to the location of the input file.
# Can be `desktop` which points to `USER_HOME/Desktop`.
save_path = same

# Name of the watermark PDF file, relative to the app directory.
watermark_file = Watermark.pdf

# New PDF file suffix, which will be appended to the converted file.
new_file_suffix = _w
```

## 🚀 Start from Source

To start the app within your IDE start the included run configuration:

* ▶ `PDFWatermark.xml`

Alternatively you can start the app with the [Gradle](https://gradle.org) command:

```shell
gradle run
```

This will start the application main class: `eu.tobse.tool.pdfwatermark.App`.  
(File: `app/src/main/java/eu/tobse/tool/pdfwatermark/App.java`)

## 🔨 Build Jar

To build a runnable jar with all dependencies, run
the [Gradle Shadow Plugin](https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/):

```shell
gradle shadowJar
```

The output file will be saved in: `build/libs/app-all.jar`.

## 🗂 Dependencies

All dependencies are included in the `app\lib` folder. No external maven or grade dependencies are needed.
Gradle will link them automatically. If you want to build the project without Gradle,
just add it as _dependencies_ folder in your IDE.
